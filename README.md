# Codedex-Calculator

Built this calculator based off the following instructions from Codedex, as my midpoint project part of the Python Beginner Course
Checkpoint Project ‚õ≥Ô∏è

Congratulations on completing the first four chapters of The Legend of Python! Now let's use the skills you've learned (variables, control flow statements, and loops) to build a Python project on your own.

Use the Python Code Editor, Visual Studio Code, or your code editor of choice for this project.

Area Calculator
Create a calculator.py program that calculates the area of one of the following shapes:

Square
Rectangle
Triangle
Circle
The program should present a menu for the user to choose which shape to calculate, then ask them for the appropriate values (side, length, width, etc.).

Then, it should calculate the area and print it out.

The output should look something like this:
